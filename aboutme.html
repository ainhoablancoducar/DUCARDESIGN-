        <div class="funfact"> Fun fact
            I’ve always had a wild imagination and I never run away from difficulties. For example, when I was a kid I
            used to revisit my most frightening nightmares just to find a way to solve them.
            This same attitude applies to my work. As a UX Designer I am always looking for ways to improve the products
            and make technology work for people. My empathetic nature drives me to acknowledge the needs and
            frustrations of users so I can design products that solve them effectively.

        <div class="careerchanger">
            I’m a career changer!
            Which means I am highly adaptable, curious and eager to continuously learn new skills and face new
            challenges. But I also bring a set of skills and experiences I have gained throughout my life that have
            prepared me for my role as a UX Designer:

            Acting was my gateway into understanding human behavior. I have always been fascinated by the power of
            storytelling and how it can evoke emotions in an audience. And this is why I use it to create a positive and
            comfortable journey with my designs. Also, theatre is collaborative by nature and this has honed my skills
            in adaptability, teamwork, and creativity, making me even more equipped to design user-centric solutions.
            As a public speaking teacher, I also have a solid foundation in team management, communication, expressive
            control and stage presence, which enables me to conduct meetings and presentations with ease and confidence.

            Thanks to customer service, I know that a bit of patience and kind attitude can improve the experience and
            reassure customers their needs have been heard and help is on its way.

        <div class="human">
            I’m human too ;)
            Beyond my professional life, I am a woman who is passionate about nature, art, culture and connecting with
            others. I enjoy crafting costumes and performing stories, playing my ukelele, skating and strolling
            outdoors. Furthermore, I am an enthusiastic feminist, have great respect for the environment, and seek to
            make my time here on this Earth a joyful and meaningful one.
